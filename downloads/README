Ensemble perft - get access to CPU performance counters

 The  group of commands can be used to access CPU perfrmance counter data for
different kind of events e.g. cache events, branch mispredictions etc.


Installation:

Unix:
	I) Install PAPI (if necessary)
		1) Go to http://icl.cs.utk.edu/papi/
		2) Download the PAPI software
		3) tar xfz
		4) cd src
		5) ./configure
		6) make
		7) sudo make install
		8) sudo make install-man

	II) Install extension
		1) ./configure --prefix=tcl_installlation_directory_path
		2) make
		3) make test
		4) make install

	Your libpapi.so must be present in your /usr/lib.
	
	III) use the extension by including the perft package in your scripts
		e.g. you can add a line like
		package require Perft 1.0

Windows:
	I) Install Microsoft Visual Studio or MIngW g++ (If necessary)

	II) Install perfinsp package (if necessary)
		1) Go to http://http://perfinsp.sourceforge.net/install_windows.html
		2) Download the perfinsp package (32-bit/64-bit as may be the case)
		3) cd /d c:\ibmperf 
		4) unzip {pi_win32.zip | pi_win64.zip}
		5) tinstall
	Each time you want to use perft extension, the path to 'perfutil.dll' should be present in your 'path' environment variable. The correct path can be set by running
	c:\ibmperf\bin\setrunenv in the same command prompt window.
	(This will set the runtime environment. This should be done in order to extension to locate 'perfutil.dll')

	III) choose one of the two makefiles (these correspond to MingW g++ and visual studio respectively)
		1) Check TCLI (path to tcl.h)
		2) Check TCLLIB (name of link option for Tcl stubs library [e.g. tcl85.lib in case of tcl8.5])
		3) Check CXX (path to MingW C++)
		4) Check TCLINTREP (tcl interpreter)

	IV) make (install make tool if not installed already)

	V) test
	    make test	

	VI) Put the build files at appropriate locations
		1) Create a directory Perft1.0 in your 'lib'/'library' directory inside the tcl installation directory [you may choose any other directory as per your convenience but you should change your auto_path variable accordingly.]
		2) Copy Perft.dll, pkgIndex.tcl and PerftWidget.tcl to this directory
	
	VII)  use the extension by including the perft package in your scripts
		e.g. you can add a line like
		package require Perft 1.0
	

Usage:

       perft::select_events
       perft::init listOfEvents
       perft::run_script script
       perft::run_file filename
       perft::counters

       perft::select_events provides with a GUI for selecting the set of events  to
       be  recorded  during  next run of perft::run_script or perft::run_file  com‐
       mands.

       perft::init is used to initialise the event set manually by explicitly  pro‐
       viding a Tcl list of standard event names (listOfEvents) as an argument.

       perft::run_script  is used after calling perft::select_events or perft::init
       to record the events for a tcl script (script) passed as an argument.

       perft::run_script is used after calling perft::select_events or  perft::init
       to  record  the  events for a tcl file whose name (filename) is passed as an
       argument.

       perft::counters returns the number of CPU performance counters present on  a
       particular system.

       For  usage  examples  and  other  implementation  details  one  should refer
