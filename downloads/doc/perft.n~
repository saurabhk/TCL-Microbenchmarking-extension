.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The group of commands can be used to access CPU perfrmance counter data for 
different kind of events e.g. cache events, branch mispredictions etc.
.PP
\fBperft::select_events\fR provides with a GUI for selecting the set of events to be recorded during
next run of \fBperft::run_script\fR or \fBperft::run_file\fR  commands.
.PP
\fBperft::init\fR is used to initialise the event set manually by explicitly providing a Tcl list of standard
event names (\fBlistOfEvents\fR) as an argument.
.PP
\fBperft::run_script\fR is used after calling \fBperft::select_events\fR or \fBperft::init\fR to record the events
for a tcl script (\fBscript\fR) passed as an argument.
.PP
\fBperft::run_file\fR is used after calling \fBperft::select_events\fR or \fBperft::init\fR to record the events
for a tcl file whose name (\fBfilename\fR) is passed as an argument.
.PP
\fBperft::counters\fR returns the number of CPU performance counters present on a particular system.
